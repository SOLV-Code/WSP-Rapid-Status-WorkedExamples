# Learning to assign WSP rapid statuses with decision tree - Practical Exercises

You will need three things:

1.	Copy of WSP rapid status decision tree; there is the full decision tree that is required and a simplified decision tree when you are starting out to understand basic concepts. These are available LINK.

2.	Information required to assign status for each CU: includes data summaries and table of supporting information; assume you are the expert on these CUs and what is contained in the tables and figures below is some of your knowledge on these CUs

3.	Form to fill in for each CU as you step through to assign status and provide any additional narrative on the data. After you assign status you could assign any notes or observations or things you would want to check and understand before finalizing. A template is available LINK

Update Numbers!

**Metrics and Data Types** | **CU Information**
-- | --
Can Absolute Abundance be used? | Yes-data are fence counts of absolute abundance
Can relative abundance metric be used	| Yes benchmarks align with abundance time series
Current generation average	| 35,000
Relative abundance lower threshold | 12,000
Relative abundance upper threshold	| 27,000
Long term trend current value: ratio of current abundance to long-term average| 	190%
Short term trend (3 generation average) current value |	300%
comments| recent fires in this system; lots of human activity in the area; high use of lake and streams;
